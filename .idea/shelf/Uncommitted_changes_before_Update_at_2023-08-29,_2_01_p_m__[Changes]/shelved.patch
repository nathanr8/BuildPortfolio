<+># My Personal Project\n\n## *What will the application do?*\nThe project will let users construct investment portfolios with visualized projected returns under diverse market scenarios. Investments will have a name, price, and economic sector, while portfolios will have a name, starting capital, and a 'preferred sector' that adjusts expected returns based on investment sector alignment\n## *Who will use it?*\nThe tool is designed for individual investors seeking to visualize their potential returns, as well as for investment managers aiming to provide their clients with a graphical representation of investment strategies.\n## *Why is this project of interest to me?*\nAs a Computer Science and Business major, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to enhance financial decision-making. I believe visualizing potential market scenarios can clarify the advantages of spreading investments and reduce the worries about investing.\n\n## User Stories\n- As a user, I want to be able to make a new portfolio of investments\n- As a user, I want to be able to make a new investment\n- As a user, I want to be able to add an investment to a pre-existing portfolio\n- As a user, I want to be able to delete an investment in a pre-existing portfolio\n- As a user, I want to be able to delete an investment portfolio\n- As a user, I want a visual display of an investment portfolio\n- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all the market investments\n- As a user, I want to be able to see a list of all of my portfolios\n- As a user, I want to be able to be able to save all current investments and portfolios to a file (if I so choose)\n- As a user, I want to be able to be able to load my portfolios and investments from file (if I so choose)\n\n# Instructions for Grader\n- You can generate the first required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking \"View Investments\" or on the Investments button on the pane, and then click the \"New Investment\" button. Then, enter a name for your investment, an initial price (integer) for your investment, the expected return in percentage for your investment (positive double), and its economic sector. \n- You can generate the second required action related to adding Xs to a Y by clicking \"View Portfolios\" or on the Portfolios button on the pane. Then select a portfolio or click the \"New Portfolio\" button, and enter the name of your portfolio, the integer value initial capital you are starting this portfolio with, and its economic sector. Then, click on the portfolio, and select the \"Add Investment\" button, and enter the name of the investment you would like to add, and the quantity.\n- You can locate my visual component by clicking a portfolio in the portfolio tab, and pressing the \"View Chart\" button.\n- You can save the state of my application by clicking on the \"Save Market\" button on the main menu of the application.\n- You can reload the state of my application by clicking on the \"Load Market\" button on the main menu of the application.\n\n\n## Phase 4: Task 2\n- New Market. at Wed Aug 09 20:15:54 PDT 2023\n- New Investment added to market at Wed Aug 09 20:16:21 PDT 2023\n- New Investment added to market at Wed Aug 09 20:16:34 PDT 2023\n- New Portfolio added to market at Wed Aug 09 20:16:50 PDT 2023\n- Added investment to portfolio at Wed Aug 09 20:17:09 PDT 2023\n- Removed Investment from Market at Wed Aug 09 20:17:21 PDT 2023\n- Failed to add investment to portfolio at Wed Aug 09 20:17:39 PDT 2023\n- Viewed Portfolio Chart at Wed Aug 09 20:17:46 PDT 2023\n- Removed Portfolio from Market at Wed Aug 09 20:17:58 PDT 2023\n\n\n## Phase 4: Task 3\n- If I had more time to refactor my project, I would first work on finding a way to grant portfolios access to investments within the market class, thereby eliminating duplication. I believe this adjustment would result in a smoother backend retrieval of investment objects and fewer potential errors caused by the current redundancy. Moreover, it would conserve storage space, a factor that grows in significance as programs become larger.\n- Additionally, I would aim to establish a more abstract class to capture the shared behaviour involved in displaying both the portfolio and investment classes. I would intend to create a 'MarketUI' class, granting it access to its internal elements, and crafting individual abstract classes for presenting the lists of investments and portfolios. This approach would effectively reduce code duplication and establish a more consistent method of presenting diverse data types. The same principle would apply to the panel classes and display classes.
