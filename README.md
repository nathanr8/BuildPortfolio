# My Personal Project

## *What will the application do?*
The project will let users construct investment portfolios with visualized projected returns under diverse market scenarios. Investments will have a name, price, and economic sector, while portfolios will have a name, starting capital, and a 'preferred sector' that adjusts expected returns based on investment sector alignment
## *Who will use it?*
The tool is designed for individual investors seeking to visualize their potential returns, as well as for investment managers aiming to provide their clients with a graphical representation of investment strategies.
## *Why is this project of interest to me?*
As a Computer Science and Business major, I'm passionate about leveraging technology to enhance financial decision-making. I believe visualizing potential market scenarios can clarify the advantages of spreading investments and reduce the worries about investing.
